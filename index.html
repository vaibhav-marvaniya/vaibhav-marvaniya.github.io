      <p class="hero-subtitle">8+ years building and shipping Unity games</p>

      <p class="hero-text">
        Unity Team Lead and Senior Unity Developer with 8+ years building 2D &amp; 3D mobile games across hyper-casual,
        puzzle, casual, simulation and multiplayer. Comfortable taking a game from prototype to global launch, owning
        architecture, gameplay feel, UI, meta progression and performance on Android, iOS and Windows.
      </p>

      <p class="hero-text">
        Shipped multiple F2P titles with multi-million downloads, including <strong>Hyper Hostess</strong> (5M+ downloads)
        and <strong>Daily Routine 3D</strong> (1M+ downloads), and worked with publishers like Voodoo, Homa, Supersonic,
        Lion Studios, BoomHits, AppCentral and Moonee. Strong in ads, analytics and IAP stacks (Unity Ads, AdMob,
        ironSource, AppLovin MAX, Firebase, GameAnalytics, Facebook Analytics, Unity IAP) and iterating features using
        D1/D7 retention, playtime and CPI.
      </p>

      <p class="hero-text">
        Built and led the Unity team at GameYogi from zero to 10–15 people, creating onboarding docs, project templates
        and Git/Plastic workflows, and running sprints, task breakdown and code reviews. Introduced AI-assisted development
        (Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude) to speed up prototyping, SDK wrappers and documentation, while focusing on profiling,
        memory optimization and crash/ANR reduction so builds stay stable on low- and mid-range devices.

        <h2>What I do</h2>
        <p class="section-subtitle">
          Hands-on Unity development plus leading small cross-functional teams to ship and grow mobile F2P titles.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a <strong>Senior Unity Developer</strong> I design and build core gameplay, UI flows and meta systems in Unity,
          integrate ads/analytics/IAP stacks, and optimise performance for low- and mid-range Android devices. I am used to
          taking prototypes through multiple publisher iterations until KPIs like retention, playtime and CPI are hit.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a <strong>Unity Team Lead</strong> I build and mentor teams, run Agile (sprints, Kanban boards, daily stand-ups),
          create project templates and SDK checklists, and coordinate with founders and publishers on scope, risks and
          delivery. I actively use AI tools (Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude) to accelerate prototyping, code reviews and documentation.

  Owning Unity development for a small portfolio of casual and puzzle F2P titles such as Merge Glow, Nut Sort Color Match
  and Color Screw Unscrew &amp; Match — from core mechanics and UI flows to meta progression and monetization.
  Built the Unity team from scratch (interns → production developers), set coding standards, project templates and Git/Plastic
  workflows, and ran Agile delivery with sprint planning, daily stand-ups and Trello/Jira boards. Stayed hands-on for SDK
  integrations (ads, analytics, authentication, datastore/remote-config) and performance fixes, wiring custom events to KPIs
  and introducing AI-assisted development so the team could ship features faster with higher code quality.

  launch, integrating Supersonic Wisdom, IAP and analytics, and iterating on level design, difficulty and monetization using
  dashboards. Worked with publishers such as Voodoo, Homa, Supersonic, Lion Studios, BoomHits, AppCentral and Moonee,
  integrating their SDK stacks, supporting A/B tests and keeping builds lightweight and performant on low-end Android.

            <p>
              Unity Team Lead and Senior Unity Developer with 8+ years of experience building 2D &amp; 3D mobile games
              across hyper-casual, puzzle, action and simulation genres. I enjoy taking prototypes from first playable to
              global launch and owning architecture, gameplay feel, meta systems and performance on Android, iOS and
              Windows.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ve led and mentored Unity teams, shipped multi-million-download titles and integrated full F2P stacks
              (ads, analytics, IAP and LiveOps tooling). If you need someone to push new prototypes, stabilize a live
              game or help level up a small Unity team, I’d be happy to talk.
